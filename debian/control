Description: FLTK based frontend for aconnect
 aconnectgui is a FLTK based frontend for aconnect. It is written
 directly on top of the aconnect source, leaving the original source
 intact, only adding a couple of ifdefs, and some calls to the gui
 part, so it provides exactly the same functionality, but with a
 graphical userinterface.
