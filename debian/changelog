aconnectgui (0.9.0rc2-1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream changes.
  * Corrected the fiddling with "prefix" in debian/rules now adhering to the
    recommended way.

aconnectgui (0.9.0rc1-2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release, closes: Bug#146369
  * wrote manpage
  * zeroed DISTCLEANFILES in Makefile.in and .am to make it usable as a 
    rules-target and to minimize the .diff
  * corrected debian/control to not look too similar to alsamixergui ;-]
  * now native debian. debian/ tree in cvs; keeping the Debian revision
    though
  * don't build-depend automake, autoconf. Bad idea.
  * found that I can have two dashes in the version
  * added url to debian/control
